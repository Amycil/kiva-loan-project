# kiva-loan-project

This is my first ever completed project....yay!
The project's aim is to analyze how loans are distributed by country, by gender and by activity(that is what the loan is being used for).
It answered a couple of questions and suggested solutions to the issues that came up with the analysis of the data. 

It is quite a simple poject....looking forward to working on more projects going forward and having them published here.
