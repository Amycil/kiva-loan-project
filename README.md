## KIVA LOAN PROJECT
This data is of a loan company called Kiva. They award loas to individuals or corporations.

## OBJECTIVE
- The project's aim is to analyze how loans are distributed by country, by gender and by activity(that is what the loan is being used for).
- I was curious to find a pattern in the loans given out, if the amount was awarded by purpose of the loan(activity feature in the dataset), by country or by the gender of the one who applied for the loan.

## PROCESS
- Having a couple of questions in mind, I used visualizations to find any connections or patterns between the features.
- And answered those questions using the output i got from those visualizations.

It is quite a simple poject....looking forward to working on more projects going forward and having them published here.
